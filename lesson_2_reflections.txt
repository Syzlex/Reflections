What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-When you run git init it creates a git repository. Once the repository is created you can track changes / commits on the repository by running git log.

This is useful for version controll when working with multiple files or with other collaborators.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-It allows you to decide which changes you want to commit
